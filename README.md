# Power-System-Fault-Detection-and-Classification

This project focuses on detecting and classifying different types of faults in a power distribution system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing voltage and current phasor data, the system identifies whether the condition is normal or one of several fault types: Line-to-Ground (LG), Line-to-Line (LL), or Three-Phase (LLL) faults.

Using a Kaggle dataset and Python-based data science libraries, the model was trained using a Random Forest classifier and achieved high accuracy. The system aims to assist power grid operators in real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis to improve grid reliability and reduce downtime.

The solution is developed using:
Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
IBM Watson Studio (Cloud Lite)
